class PackageSource:
    """
    Provides information about specifications and dependencies to the resolver,
    allowing the VersionResolver class to remain generic while still providing power
    and flexibility.

    This contract contains the methods that users of Mixology must implement
    using knowledge of their own model classes.

    Note that the following concepts needs to be implemented
    in order to make the resolver work as best as possible:


    ## Package

    This user-defined class will be used to represent
    the various packages being resolved.

    __str__() will be called when providing information and feedback,
    in most cases it should return the name of the package.

    It also should implement __eq__ and __hash__.


    ## Version

    This user-defined class will be used to represent a single version.

    Versions of the same package will be compared to each other, however
    they do not need to store their associated package.

    As such they should be comparable. __str__() should also preferably be defined.


    ## Dependency

    This user-defined class represents a requirement of a package to another.

    It is returned by dependencies_for(package, version) and will be passed to
    convert_dependency(dependency) to convert it to a format Mixology understands.

    __eq__() should be defined.
