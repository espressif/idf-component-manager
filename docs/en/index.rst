===============================================================

The IDF Component Manager is a tool that allows developers to manage components for the ESP-IDF development framework. The tool is compatible with ESP-IDF versions 4.1 and later, and is included by default starting with ESP-IDF version 4.4.

The ESP Component Registry is a central repository for components that can be used with the ESP-IDF. It is hosted at https://components.espressif.com and provides a convenient way for developers to discover and download components for their projects.

With the IDF Component Manager, developers can easily install components from the ESP-IDF Component Registry, streamlining the process of adding new functionality to their projects.
