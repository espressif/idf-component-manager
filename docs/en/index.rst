IDF Component Manager and ESP Component Registry Documentation
===============================================================

This documentation is for the IDF Component Manager and the ESP Component Registry. The IDF Component Manager is a tool that allows developers to easily and reliably add components developed by Espressif and the community to the projects developed with the ESP-IDF framework and create their own components for others to use.

The `ESP Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com>` is a central repository for components that can be used with the ESP-IDF via the IDF Component Manager.
