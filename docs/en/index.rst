IDF Component Manager and ESP Component Registry Documentation
==============================================================

This documentation covers the IDF Component Manager and the ESP Component Registry.

The **IDF Component Manager** is a tool that helps developers easily and reliably add components—created by Espressif or the community—to their ESP-IDF-based projects. It also allows developers to create and share their own components.

The **ESP Component Registry** (`components.espressif.com <https://components.espressif.com>`_) is the central repository for these components, which are compatible with the ESP-IDF and accessible through the IDF Component Manager.

Using the Component Manager, developers can quickly install components from the registry, simplifying the process of extending project functionality.
