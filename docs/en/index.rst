 IDF Component Manager and ESP Component Registry Documentation
################################################################

This documentation is for the IDF Component Manager and the ESP Component Registry. The IDF Component Manager is a tool that allows developers to easily and reliably add components developed by Espressif and the community to the projects developed with the ESP-IDF framework and create their own components for others to use.

The `ESP Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com>`_ is a central repository for components that can be used with the ESP-IDF via the IDF Component Manager.

With the IDF Component Manager, developers can easily install components from the ESP Component Registry, streamlining the process of adding new functionality to their projects.
