  # set this variable to use as the `image: name` for a custom branch in the master release of esp-idf
  # since we does not support `/` in docker tags, don't forget to escape the `/` in your branch name to `-`
  # for example,
  #   branch `test/foo` should be renamed to `test-foo`
  # in esp-idf, more than one `/` is not allowed, so we don't consider the corner case
